% Torei RPG
% by Gospodin


Torei is a half-finished planet out in the empty space between the galaxies.  Vast inscrutable terraforming machines rule from their ziggurats at the poles, while humans scratch out what livelihood they can around the equator.

But times have changed since the greater spacefaring society discovered Torei, and the new city-towers around the space elevator form a rich hub of intergalactic trade.  Now the powerful AIs struggle to keep the economy and ecology of the world in balance, fighting to keep their biological advances safe from scheming outsiders.  The visiting off-worlders, for their part, must learn to adjust to a society where slavery and sexual domination is the norm.

# Character Creation 

You play humans from the greater intergalactic civilization, come to Torei for your own motives both public and secret.

#### Where Are You From?

>  Earth is gone and completely forgotten.

Invent a new planet around some new star in a nearby galaxy, and make that your homeworld.  Or perhaps it's a union of worlds that you think of as your nationality.  Be creative!

> There are no sapient aliens in this setting: you must play a human.


#### Why Did You Leave? 

 1. Why did you come to Torei?
 2. What reason do you tell people?

These are often two different things!

#### Male or Female?

On Torei, your sex is extremely important.  Female Toreans outnumber males 9:1, and the whole economy runs on contracted and enslaved female labour.  Males often live lives of aristocratic privilege, but their status as breeding studs often complicates their [Relationships].

As an outsider, your life will have been different from that of a native Torean.  Think of how your experience of being a man or a woman (or however you identify) was different from that on Torei.

## Hierarchy

#### Whose power do you represent?

Torei is fond of hierarchy.  Everyone is beneath someone and above others.  What power do you serve or represent, that brought you to this world?

#### Who represents your power?

Status on Torei comes from the people you command.  Are you a manager?  An officer?  A parent?  Do you have elected status in any organization, no matter how small?


## Background 

To make a character, one of the first things you must choose is which of the five background types your character has.  Try to pick the one that best describes your character.

##### Well-Rounded 
You're straightforward, adaptable, and well-balanced.  Just the sort of person to set out to seek her or his fortune on a frontier world like Torei.

##### Strong History 
You're well educated, trained, or experienced.  You're on Torei because something about your history makes you the best choice for the trip.

##### Complicated History 
You've had a troubled past, or a series of events left their mark on you.  You're likely on Torei to grow past these problems, or to find a solution.

##### Strong Community 
You're socially adept and a good former of friendships and alliances.  You may have come to Torei as a diplomat or a trader, to try and connect the Toreans to some off-world concern.

##### Complicated Community 
You're socially vulnerable, and your [Relationships] tend to be messy.  You may have gone to Torei to get away from someone, or to try and heal a bond with others who came before you.

## Stats 

Everyone has four Stats, represented as sets of six-sided dice to be rolled during play.

###### Acuity {.stat .well .content-box}
Acuity represents your intellect, perception, fine motor control, and finesse.

It comes into play when doing something that requires attention to detail or delicate accuracy (talking, shooting, difficult piloting, picking pockets).

###### Body {.stat .well .content-box}
Body represents your health, lust, stamina, and physical ability.

It comes into play when performing a physically demanding task (running, lifting, dancing, wrestling, swordfighting).

###### Heart {.stat .well .content-box}
Heart represents your empathy, motivation to improve, and desire to help others.

It comes into play when competing in a more indirect or non-violent way (talking, racing, working, dancing).

###### Will {.stat .well .content-box}
Will represents your determination, resolve, nerves, and desire to dominate others.

It comes into play when competing directly against someone else in an attempt to best them (wrestling, swordfighting, shooting, dogfighting, breaking a slave).

## Traits

Your Traits are aspects of your character that help you get what you want.  You can express Traits as narrative descriptions, skills, quotes, or even flaws. There are no set Traits to choose from. You make them up! 

The most useful Traits are the ones that make the best narrative hooks.  The more ways you can justify a trait's relevance, the more dice you'll be able to bring into play.

## Relationships

A relationship is a strong connection between your character and a person, place, organisation or fetish.  The GM decides when these grant you dice at the beginning of a conflict.

## Allocate your dice

Your [Background] type determines what dice you have to allocate.  Remember that [Stats] have a minimum of `2`{.d6} and you can't mix die sizes in [Traits] or [Relationships].

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Belongings

Does your character carry anything?  Tools of the trade?  Restraints?  Whips?  Vibrators?

> TODO: Give table for big/crap/good/AI tech

## Initiation to Torei

You may not necessarily be an insider on Torei yet, but you've been there long enough for it to make its mark on you.  Consider the period between your arrival on Torei and the start of play, and write down something you hope to have accomplished.

Perhaps you hope that you got out of debt, or broke a slave's will, or resisted falling in love with an abuser.  Whatever you choose, make sure it isn't something that would ruin your character if you lose.  "I hope that I didn't die" won't work!

The GM will run a [Conflict] between your character and `4`{.d6} `4`{.d10} in opposition.  The result will be a new `1`{.d6} trait, such as "I stayed debt-free ever since the belt came off" or "I never did earn my slave's respect."

# Conflict 

##### Do you want something, but someone is stopping you?
Say "conflict"!

##### What are you fighting over?
That's the *stakes*.

##### Who was in the scene when you said "conflict"?
They can join in. Characters who join later can [Help].

## Roll Stats and Relationships

The first step is to roll the dice from two of your [Stats].  All your rolls go into a pool of dice in front of you, where everyone can see.

Which two [Stats] you roll depends on how you're trying to get what you want:

###### Talking {.action .well .content-box}

![If you're *talking*, everyone involved will roll [Acuity] + [Heart].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/conversation.svg) 

###### Moving {.action .well .content-box}

![If the competition is *physical*, you roll [Body] + [Heart].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/sprint.svg) 

###### Fighting {.action .well .content-box}

![If it's *violent*, you roll [Body] + [Will].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/crossed-swords.svg) 

###### Manoeuvring {.action .well .content-box}

![ If it's a contest of *skill and finesse*, roll [Acuity] + [Will].](icons/lorc/originals/svg/on-target.svg)

### Are your relationships at stake?

Roll the dice now for any [Relationships] involved in the [Conflict].

Don't roll your [Traits] or belongings yet!

#### Who goes First?

The person with the 2 highest rolled dice makes the first [Challenge]. If multiple people are involved, always pick the person who has the next 2 highest dice.

#### Who Wins?

The last person in the [Conflict] wins, and tells us what happens to the stakes.

Everyone then discards all remaining dice, and rolls fallout.

## Challenge

##### 1st Die {.col-md-offset-2 .die .bg-info .content-box}
![Push one die if that's all you have left.](icons/delapouite/dice/svg/perspective-dice-six-faces-random.svg)

##### 2nd Die {.die .bg-info .content-box}
![But if you have at least two dice, you must push two.](icons/delapouite/dice/svg/perspective-dice-six-faces-random.svg)

### Push forward any 2 dice from your pool.

> Never push more than two in a [Challenge]!


### The higher the total on the dice, the better.

1) If you don't have any dice to push forward, you *lose*.
2) Describe how you try to get what you want.  It must be something the targets *can't ignore*.
3) Each target makes a [Response].
4) After all responses are done, discard these dice.

## Response 

The target of the [Challenge] pushes forward enough dice to match the total from the [Challenge].

###### 1 Die {.die .bg-success .content-box}
![If you met the challenge with only one die, you're *Reversing The Blow*.  Describe how you turn your challenger's actions to your advantage, and then re-use this die in your next [Challenge]!](icons/lorc/originals/svg/shield-reflect.svg)

###### 2 Dice {.die .bg-warning .content-box}
![If you met the challenge with exactly two dice, you've *Blocked*.  Describe how you prevented the challenger from affecting you.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/arrows-shield.svg)

###### 3 Dice {.die .bg-danger .content-box}
![If you use three dice to meet the [Challenge], you're *Taking the Blow*.  Describe how the challenger's actions harmed you, and set aside three [Fallout] dice to roll after the [Conflict]!](icons/lorc/originals/svg/broken-shield.svg)

###### ..or more! {.die .bg-danger .content-box}
![The more dice you use in your [Response], the more [Fallout] dice you need to roll. This can lead to greater harm, but also greater experience.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/broken-shield.svg)

### Fewer Dice is Better

The outcome of the challenge depends on how many dice were used to respond.

## Need more Dice?

* Get [Help]
* Use [Traits and Belongings]
* [Change the Game]

> Don't forget that [Giving In is Awesome]!

If you can't match the [Challenge]'s total, you *lose* the stakes.

After responding, discard these dice (unless you *Reversed the Blow*).

#### Change the Game

Are you shooting? Take it physical and run away! Fighting? Take it to talking with threats or bargaining. Whatever you do, it must be something the other person *can't ignore*!

> Roll Anew and Strike Back!

Everyone immediately rolls stat dice for the new type of conflict. 

Don't re-roll any stats you've already rolled, and don't discard any dice already in your pool. 

If you change the game to a type nobody's rolled yet, you do not need to respond, and can instead make your own [Challenge] now!

#### Traits and Belongings 

1. Describe how one of your [Traits] or [Belongings] helps you.
2. Roll it and add the dice to your pool.

> You can only use each trait or belonging once per [Conflict].

#### Help

Anyone can help by describing and rolling a relevant trait or belonging, then giving you their single highest rolled die. The rest are discarded. They now can't use this trait or belonging in their next conflict.

### Give In

You can give in the stakes at any time, even when someone is challenging you. This saves you from needing to respond, and can prevent fallout!

Keep your 2 highest dice in your pool for your next conflict (don't re-roll them!) You can't help in this same conflict.

# Fallout

After a conflict, roll all your fallout dice (if any) together. 

If any of these rolled dice come up 1, you gain an [Experience]!


> You only claim one experience per conflict.


Then take the two highest fallout dice you rolled and add them together.  Choose harm from the following table:

  Roll    [Short-Term Harm]    [Permanent Harm]
------   -------------------  ------------------
   2-7            1
  8-10            1                    1
 11-15            1                    2
 16-19            2                    3
    20                              *Death!*

## Short-Term Harm

[Short-Term Harm] only lasts for one conflict, or as the story requires.

###### Dazed {.harm .bg-danger .content-box}

![Dazed reduces the die size of your [Acuity] from `#`{.d6} to `#`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/six-eyes.svg) 

###### Bound {.harm .bg-danger .content-box}

![Bound reduces the die size of your [Body] from `#`{.d6} to `#`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/imprisoned.svg) 

###### Broken {.harm .bg-danger .content-box}

![Broken reduces the die size of your [Will] from `#`{.d6} to `#`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/despair.svg) 

###### Shamed {.bg-danger .harm .content-box}

![Shamed reduces the die size of your [Heart] from `#`{.d6} to `#`{.d4}.](icons/lorc/originals/svg/paranoia.svg) 

## Permanent Harm

> TODO: drop a die, lower a trait to d4...

## Experience

Per the circumstances of the story, choose one:

* Gain a 1d6 trait, relationship, or belonging.
* Add one die to an existing trait, relationship, or belonging.
* Add 2 to the die size (max: 10) of an existing trait, relationship, or belonging.

# Play Advice

#### How to Think about Dice

Lots of small dice can win you the stakes, but they're more likely to cause [Fallout]. It's true that `3`{.d4} can total up to 12 just as `2`{.d6} can, but needing 3 dice to respond instead of 2 increases your [Fallout]. So having that fistful of `#`{.d4} can win you the stakes, but you will pay for it later!

#### How to Think about Fallout

Fallout also has a die-size element to it, keyed to the type of conflict you're engaged in. The smaller dice used for the non-violent conflict types make it more likely that some of them will come up 1, earning you an [Experience]. We learn more consistently by talking or doing than we do by fighting, after all!

### How to Think about Changing The Game

The original name for changing the game was "escalation", and that still confuses a lot of people who are new to Dogs or its offshoots.

It's true that you can escalate from peaceful approaches to more violent ones, but what's most important is that the current approach won't work for you and you're not willing to give up the stakes.

> A pirate who breaks from a swordfight to swing from the chandelier is changing the game every bit as much as a cowgirl who draws her pistol on an argument!


### Giving In is Awesome

If you're willing to surrender the stakes, giving in can be one of the most powerful moves you have! You get to keep your two best rolls in your pool, and use them in your next [Conflict]. You also avoid any further risk of [Fallout], and this can help you aim for [Experience].

A submissive character may well play a long game of rope-a-dope, giving in to a dominant character regularly just to gain the upper hand on the next [Conflict].

Consenting to submit as a beneficial game mechanic: it's one of the reasons the Torei RPG uses these rules!
